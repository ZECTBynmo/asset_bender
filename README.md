## Asset Bender

Asset Bender is a package/dependency manager, local server, and build tools for front-end assets (Javascript, Coffeescript, CSS, SASS, images, etc). It is focused on speeding up and alleviating the difficulties when sharing front-end code between teams. To learn more (the how/what/why), read these posts:

 - [HubSpot's approach to front-end development at scale](http://dev.hubspot.com/blog/frontend-development-at-scale-1)
 - __Todo, reference the rest of the http://dev.hubspot.com/blog posts that are on their way...__

If you'd like to see or try out the fully-functional legacy version (that is still somewhat coupled to HubSpot internals), check out the [master branch](https://github.com/HubSpot/asset_bender/tree/master).
